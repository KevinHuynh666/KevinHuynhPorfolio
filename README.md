### Working Experience

### QUT Motorsport - Component Store App

###### Auxiliary team

Git: [link](https://github.com/KevinHuynh666/component-store)
This project was a part of my Design Camp's internship for QUT Motorsport Club. The main focus of the project is: developing a web app with basic front-end to manage electrical components from a database to easily keep track of components in the workshop's drawers. User needs to be able to scan the drawer (with QR code) to ge the component's information.
This was a pair project, with me responsible for the Front-End and my partner taking care of the back-end. My framework of choice was ReactJS and NextJS. Additional CSS library like Tailwind was used to decorate our website.

Tiikr is a software company utilizing in creating digital forms for web and mobile. The idea is : instead of printing forms, Tiikr can create a digital form as of customer's request.
