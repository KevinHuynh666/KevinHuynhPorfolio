This project was a part of my Design Camp's internship for QUT Motorsport Club. The main focus of the project is: developing a web app with basic front-end to manage electrical components from a database to easily keep track of components in the workshop's drawers. User needs to be able to scan the drawer (with QR code) to ge the component's information.
This was a pair project, with me responsible for the Front-End and my partner taking care of the back-end. My framework of choice was ReactJS and NextJS. Additional CSS library like Tailwind was used to decorate our website.

This was an individual project. The main tasks for me (for both occasions) was creating new components for the form. All the components were create using AngularJS and CSS. The components I created had positive reviews from the supervisors.

This was a personal project. Design a database schema from scratch and implement, deploy the database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and Visual Studio. For designing the database, I chose star schema since the data is small and simple; then creating the database using SQL script. Then, I developed an SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - using Visual Studio - to perform ETL (Extract Transform Load) on the data source to put them into the database. And finally, I created an OLAP cube for the users/customers in order to view the data base on their requirements.
